Description: Due to a limited availability of observed high-resolution precipitation records with adequate length, simulations with stochastic precipitation models are used to generate series for subsequent studies [e.g. Khaliq and Cunmae, 1996, <doi:10.1016/0022-1694(95)02894-3>, Vandenberghe et al., 2011, <doi:10.1029/2009WR008388>]. This package contains an R implementation of the original Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse model (BLRPM), developed by Rodriguez-Iturbe et al. (1987) <doi:10.1098/rspa.1987.0039>. It contains a function for simulating a precipitation time series based on storms and cells generated by the model with given or estimated model parameters. Additionally BLRPM parameters can be estimated from a given or simulated precipitation time series. The model simulations can be plotted in a three-layer plot including an overview of generated storms and cells by the model (which can also be plotted individually), a continuous step-function and a discrete precipitation time series at a chosen aggregation level.
